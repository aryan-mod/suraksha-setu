# Suraksha Setu - Smart India Hackathon Tourist Safety Prototype

## Overview

**Suraksha Setu** (‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ ‡§∏‡•á‡§§‡•Å) is a comprehensive tourist safety web application prototype developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH). The name "Suraksha Setu" translates to "Safety Bridge" in Hindi, symbolizing our mission to bridge the gap between tourists and their safety needs through technology.

This application provides real-time safety monitoring, emergency response capabilities, and multilingual support specifically designed for India's diverse tourism landscape. The prototype demonstrates core safety features including SOS emergency alerts, live location tracking, role-based authentication, and comprehensive multilingual support across 5+ Indian languages.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application uses Next.js 14 with App Router architecture, providing server-side rendering and static generation capabilities. The UI is built with React components using TypeScript for type safety, styled with Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, and enhanced with Radix UI components for accessible design patterns.

The component architecture follows a modular approach with reusable UI components, specialized feature components for safety systems, custom hooks for state management, and context providers for global state like language and theme preferences.

### Backend Architecture
The backend utilizes Next.js API routes for serverless functions, providing endpoints for AI chat interactions, location tracking and heatmap data, notification systems, and authentication flows. Supabase serves as the Backend-as-a-Service platform, handling authentication, real-time database operations, and row-level security policies.

### Authentication & Authorization
User authentication is managed through Supabase Auth with email/password authentication, email verification flows, and middleware-based route protection. Session management uses Supabase's built-in session handling with automatic token refresh.

### Real-Time Features
The system implements real-time capabilities through Supabase's real-time subscriptions for live location tracking, instant emergency notifications, and live safety zone updates. WebSockets enable real-time communication for the AI chatbot and emergency response coordination.

### AI Integration
Google Gemini AI is integrated for intelligent chatbot responses with multilingual support, contextual safety recommendations, and emergency situation analysis. The system includes fallback responses when the AI service is unavailable, ensuring continuous operation.

### Location Services
Geolocation features include HTML5 Geolocation API for position tracking, custom geofencing algorithms for safety zone monitoring, and proximity-based notifications and alerts. Location data is processed and stored for heatmap generation and safety analytics.

### Multilingual Support
The application provides comprehensive internationalization through a custom language provider supporting 20+ languages, Google Translate integration for dynamic content translation, RTL text support for Arabic and Hebrew, and localized emergency contact information.

### Progressive Web App Features
PWA capabilities include service worker implementation for offline functionality, push notification support for emergency alerts, app manifest for installability, and cached resources for offline access to critical safety information.

### Notification System
Multi-channel notification delivery includes in-app notifications for real-time alerts, push notifications for emergency situations, email notifications for critical updates, and SMS integration for emergency contacts (planned).

### Safety Monitoring
The safety system features real-time location tracking with accuracy monitoring, geofencing with customizable safety zones, emergency SOS button with immediate response, safety scoring algorithms, and incident reporting and tracking.
